# Simple-Phone-Book
Back-End Project Developed By Django

I did this project as a beginner to learn basics in djnago framework.
this project is a simple phone book that has CRUD operations using django forms and class-based views.
you can acess server side operations in Phones/views.py and client side files in templates. as you can see the front-end part is rendering html codes.
for CRUD operations I use class-based views like ListView, DeleteView and UpdateView and also a form that connected to my model.
you can see my models in Phones/models.py path.
